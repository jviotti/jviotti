### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Technical Lead and Engineering Manager at
[Postman](https://www.postman.com) focusing on Desktop Engineering, and a
graduate student at University of Oxford doing research on binary serialization
and JSON Schema. Some facts about me:

- I won the 2022 CAR Hoare prize at the University of Oxford for my research around [JSON BinPack](https://www.jsonbinpack.org), citing that I "understood existing techniques in such depth that you could measurably refine and improve upon years of industry standards"
- I'm co-authoring an O'Reilly book expected to come out in 2024
- I lead the development of Starship, a framework to create cross-platform native applications using web technologies
- I'm the original author of [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/), a very popular open-source cross-platform image flasher recommended by a range of GNU/Linux distributions
