### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Technical Lead and Engineering Manager at
[Postman](https://www.postman.com) focusing on Desktop Engineering, and a
graduate student at University of Oxford doing research on binary serialization
and JSON Schema. 

I'm currently working on various projects:

- **Starship**: I lead the development of a next-generation comprehensive
  framework to build cross-platform applications using web technologies
  codenamed Starship. If you maintain an application built using Electron.js,
  CEF, NW.js, Tauri or similar frameworks, do [reach
  out](mailto:juan.viotti@postman.com). I'd love share notes and learn more
  about the challenges you are facing.

- **JSON BinPack**: I lead the development of a space-efficient schema-driven
  and schema-less binary serialization format based on [JSON
  Schema](http://json-schema.org) called [JSON
  BinPack](https://www.jsonbinpack.org). So far, [my
  research](https://benchmark.sourcemeta.com) has proven JSON BinPack to be
  more space-efficient than every considered alternative in every case when
  taking a sample set of real-world documents. 

- **Talaria**: I lead the development of a cross-platform hermetic development
  environment in a box codenamed Talaria. Talaria is a relocatable environment
  that resembles a [`chroot`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot) environment
  for macOS, Windows and GNU/Linux. It provides every necessary dependency to
  build a wide range of software, including Node.js, Chromium and Electron.

- **Alterschema**: I lead the development of a tool called
  [Alterschema](https://alterschema.sourcemeta.com) to automatically upgrade
  JSON Schema definitions across versions of the specification based on a set
  of formal transformation rules implemented using JSON-e and JSON Schema
  itself.

#### Previous projects

- **Etcher**: I created and led the development of
  [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/), a popular open-source cross-platform
  image flasher.
