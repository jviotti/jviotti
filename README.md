### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Technical Lead at [Postman](https://www.postman.com) focusing on Desktop
Engineering and a graduate student at University of Oxford. I'm currently
working on various projects:

- **Starship**: I'm leading the development of a next-generation comprehensive
  framework to build cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies
  codenamed Starship. If you are into Chromium, Electron.js, C++, JavaScript
  and remote working, do [reach out](mailto:juan.viotti@postman.com). We've
  closed a [Series D round of
  $225M](https://blog.postman.com/postman-announces-series-d/) and we are
  hiring!

- **JSON BinPack**: I'm building a space-efficient schema-driven binary
  serialization format for IoT and the web based on [JSON
  Schema](http://json-schema.org) called JSON BinPack. My research so far has
  proven this format to be more space-efficient than ASN.1 PER, Apache
  Avro, Microsoft Bond, BSON, Cap'n Proto, CBOR, FlatBuffers, MessagePack,
  Protocol Buffers, Smile, Apache Thrift and UBJSON in every case when taking a
  sample set of real-world documents. This project will be open-source once I
  submit my dissertation!

If we share similar interests, [shoot me an e-mail](mailto:jv@jviotti.com) and
let's have a virtual coffee to exchange thoughts!

#### Previous projects

- **Etcher**: I created and led the development of
  [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/), a popular open-source cross-platform
  image flasher.
