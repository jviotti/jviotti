### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Technical Lead at [Postman](https://www.postman.com) focusing on Desktop
Engineering and a graduate student at University of Oxford. I'm currently
working on various projects:

- I'm leading the development of a next-generation comprehensive framework to
  build cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies. If you are
  into Chromium, Electron.js, C++, JavaScript and remote working, do [reach
  out](mailto:juan.viotti@postman). We are hiring!

- I'm building a very space-efficient schema-driven binary serialization format
  for IoT and the web based on [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org). This
  project will be open-source once I submit by dissertation!
