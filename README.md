### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Technical Lead and Engineering Manager at
[Postman](https://www.postman.com) focusing on Desktop Engineering and a
graduate student at University of Oxford. I'm currently working on various
projects:

- **Starship**: I'm leading the development of a next-generation comprehensive
  framework to build cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies
  codenamed Starship. If you maintain an application built using Electron.js,
  CEF, NW.js, Tauri or similar frameworks, do [reach
  out](mailto:juan.viotti@postman.com). I'd love share notes and learn more
  about the challenges you are facing.

- **JSON BinPack**: I develop a space-efficient schema-driven binary
  serialization format for IoT and the web based on [JSON
  Schema](http://json-schema.org) called [JSON
  BinPack](https://github.com/jviotti/jsonbinpack). My research so far has
  proven this format to be more space-efficient than ASN.1 PER, Apache Avro,
  Microsoft Bond, BSON, Cap'n Proto, CBOR, FlatBuffers, MessagePack, Protocol
  Buffers, Smile, Apache Thrift and UBJSON in every case when taking a sample
  set of real-world documents. The experimental prototype is open-source and
  I'm currently working on a C++ production implementation.

If we share similar interests, [shoot me an e-mail](mailto:jv@jviotti.com) and
let's have a virtual coffee to exchange thoughts!

#### Previous projects

- **Etcher**: I created and led the development of
  [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/), a popular open-source cross-platform
  image flasher.
